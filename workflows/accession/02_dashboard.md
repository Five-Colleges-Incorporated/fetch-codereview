# Accession Dashboard

#### The good

Using a python library for paging results.

Using the quasar table library inside EssentialTable enforcing consistency.
Pagination filtering is implemented according to Quasar docs.

#### The ok but notable

Not awaiting async method in onBeforeMount.
Fine to load data in background but surprising.

Inconsistent scoping of similar variable names
resetAccessionStore (method on store)
loadAccessionJobs (method in dashboard)

Hand-rolling filter -> sql conversion in python.

Confusing naming with 'update-pagination' being emitted from the @request handler.
This is the appropriate usage of @request but it isn't immediately clear why the event is 'update-pagination'.
Same confusion with 'pagination-is-loading' meaning just fetching data.

Using an apparent private? property __thClass of Quasar.
I don't know if there's a better way to make it accessible like it's doing without it though?

#### Areas of improvement

:enable-table-reorder defaults to false, is passed as false in a lot of places.
Is never passed as true. What does it do and why is it here adding complication?

:heading-row-class is subtly different in some places but the same in many others
Why is this configurable and required to be passed?

:heading-filter-class is the same everywhere (but not passed in)

First taste of css in the project.
It's kind of random and not documented why it needs to be css and can't be a quasar prop.
