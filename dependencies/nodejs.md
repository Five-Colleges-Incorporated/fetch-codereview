## Dependencies Summary

#### The good
Vue + Quasar + Pinia is both a modern and mature stack for building a PWA in 2025.
I have a lot of confidence in these choices.

There are a small number of production dependencies.

#### The ok but notable

@quasar/extras is a package with a lot of useful fonts/icons (and some animations too).
Only roboto, material-icons, and mdi is being used.
No harm to keeping it.

#### Areas of improvement

The [status of momentjs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) has been clear for years now.
It should not be used for new projects and should be replaced here.

@quasar/app-vite has a breaking changes at version 2.

#### The good
The standard method for scaffolding a new quasar project was likely used here.
This project has all the standard dev dependencies for working with quasar/vue/vite/pinia/etc...

#### The ok but notable
It's not clear what the steps are to automatically keep a quasar project up to date over time.

#### Areas of improvement
Quaser App Extension Testing has a deprecation notice and should be removed.
